          Debugging is not luck. It is not staring at the screen until something clicks.
          It is a skill with a method — and once you have the method, bugs stop feeling

        <p className="text-base text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
          This sounds obvious. Most developers do not do it. They see red text, panic,
          and immediately start changing things at random.
        </p>
        <p className="text-base text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
          Read the entire error. The type, the message, and especially the stack trace.
          The stack trace is a list of function calls that led to the failure, with file
          names and line numbers. The actual bug is almost always one of the top three
          frames — usually the first one that is your code rather than a library.

          You are calling <code className="text-sm bg-stone-100 px-1.5 py-0.5 rounded">.map()</code> on it.
          The fix is not random — it is specific.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-serif text-foreground">Reproduce it reliably</h2>
        <p className="text-base text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
          If you cannot reproduce the bug consistently, you cannot fix it — you can only
          hope it goes away, which is not engineering, it is prayer.
        </p>
        <p className="text-base text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
          Narrow the conditions. Ask: does it happen every time, or only sometimes?
          Only on certain inputs? Only after a specific sequence of actions? Only in
          production, not locally? Each answer eliminates a category of causes.
        </p>
        <p className="text-base text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
          Intermittent bugs are almost always timing issues — race conditions, async
          operations completing in the wrong order, or data that arrives later than you
          assumed. Knowing this narrows the search dramatically.

          Good debugging follows the same structure as science. Not intuition — method.

            ["Observe", "What exactly is happening? What did you expect?"],

            ["Predict", "If your hypothesis is correct, what else must be true? What should you see in the logs?"],
            ["Test", "Make the smallest change that would confirm or deny your hypothesis."],
            ["Observe again", "Did it behave as predicted? If yes, you found the cause. If no, update the hypothesis."],
          ].map(([step, desc]) => (

        </div>
        <p className="text-base text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
          The key discipline is testing one hypothesis at a time. When you change three
          things simultaneously and the bug goes away, you learned nothing — and you will
          not be able to reproduce the fix next time.

        <p className="text-base text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
          When you cannot find the bug, make the reproduction smaller. Comment out code.
          Remove data. Strip the component down to its skeleton. At each step, check
          whether the bug is still present.
        </p>
        <p className="text-base text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
          If the bug disappears when you remove a block of code, the bug is in that block.
          If it persists with only 3 lines remaining, those 3 lines contain everything
          you need. You have isolated it.

          This process of creating a <strong className="text-foreground">minimal reproduction</strong> is

        <p className="text-base text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
          There is a certain developer who sneers at console.log and insists on using the
          debugger for everything. Ignore that developer. Professional engineers with 20
          years of experience use console.log all the time. It is fast, it is portable,
          and it works everywhere.

        <p className="text-base text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
          The technique: log intermediate values at each stage of a transformation. When
          the output is wrong, scan the logs from top to bottom. The first log where
          the value looks wrong is where the bug is.

              In React, a callback captures the value of a variable at the time it was created.

          is returning 200. I logged the response and the data looks correct. But the
