          A pull request is a conversation, not a code dump.
          You are not uploading files to a server. You are proposing a change to a shared
          codebase and asking your teammates to review it.
          How you do that matters as much as the code itself.

        <p className="text-base text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
          There is an informal rule that teams discover for themselves: PRs under 400 lines
          get reviewed carefully. PRs over 800 lines get rubber-stamped. This is not
          laziness — it is cognitive reality. A reviewer can hold 400 lines of context in
          their head. They cannot hold 1,200.
        </p>
        <p className="text-base text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
          If your change is large, split it. Ship the refactoring as one PR, the new
          feature as a second, the tests as part of the feature PR. Each should be
          reviewable in under 30 minutes.
        </p>
        <p className="text-base text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
          Small PRs also merge faster, which means shorter-lived branches, fewer merge
          conflicts, and faster feedback on whether your approach is right.

        <p className="text-base text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
          Do not mix refactoring with features. Do not mix a bug fix with an unrelated
          cleanup. When you mix concerns in a PR, reviewers have to figure out which diff
          is the feature and which is the cleanup — that friction leads to missed bugs.

          {`## What
Add optimistic updates to the lesson progress indicator.

## Why
Previously, clicking "Complete" would show a spinner for ~800ms
before marking the lesson done. With optimistic updates, the UI
responds instantly and rolls back if the API call fails.

## How to test
1. Open any lesson
2. Click "Complete & Next"
3. The progress indicator should update immediately
4. Disable your network and repeat — should roll back with a toast

## Tradeoffs
We are now managing two sources of truth (local + server) for
progress state. This is a known tradeoff for speed.

          Always link the issue or ticket the PR addresses. "Closes #142" or "Fixes #88"

          For complex logic — a non-obvious algorithm, a workaround for a browser bug, a
          tricky async sequence — leave a comment directly on the line in the PR. You are
          not explaining bad code, you are saving the reviewer the 10 minutes it would
          take them to figure it out themselves. That is considerate engineering.

            <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              This is the most important thing to internalize. A comment on your PR is not
              a comment on your intelligence or your worth as a developer. It is a comment
              on a specific implementation of a specific function at a specific point in
              time, written under specific time constraints with specific information.
            </p>
            <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mt-2">
              The best developers get review comments on every PR. Not because their code
              is bad — because they are working on hard problems with other sharp people
              who catch things. Review is not punishment. It is collaboration.

            <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              When you address a comment, say so. "Done." "Fixed in latest commit." "Changed
              to use reduce — good call." This tells the reviewer they can re-read that thread
              without re-reading the diff.
            </p>
            <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mt-2">
              When you disagree, say that too: "I considered reduce but went with the loop
              because it's easier to step through in the debugger — happy to change if you
              feel strongly." That is a conversation, not a stonewalling. Sometimes the
              reviewer will say "fair, keep it." Sometimes they will convince you. Both
              outcomes are fine.

              There is no argument to win in a code review. The shared goal is to ship code
              that works, that other people can maintain, and that does not create problems
              six months from now. When you frame it that way — you and the reviewer on the
              same side, against the bug or the bad abstraction — the whole conversation
              changes.
