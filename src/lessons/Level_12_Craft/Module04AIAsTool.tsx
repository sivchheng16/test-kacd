          Never ship code you don't understand.
        </p>
        <p className="text-base text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
          If AI wrote it, you still have to read it, understand it, test it, and own it.
          "The AI wrote this" is not an explanation you can give when the code causes an
          incident at 3am. You are the engineer of record. The code that goes out under
          your name is your responsibility.
        </p>
        <p className="text-base text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
          This is not an argument against using AI. It is an argument for maintaining
          your own understanding. Read the generated code line by line. Ask yourself if
          you could have written this. If something looks wrong or unclear, investigate
          before shipping.

        <CodeBlock language="json">
          {`// Vague — produces generic code that probably doesn't fit
"Write a function to fetch users"

"Write a TypeScript function using fetch() that:
- Takes userId: string as a parameter
- Calls GET /api/users/:id
- Returns Promise<User | null> (null on 404)
- Throws on other error status codes
- Follow this existing pattern:
  [paste a similar function from your codebase]"`}

        <p className="text-base text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
          Showing an existing pattern from your codebase is the most powerful move.
          The AI will match your naming conventions, your error handling style, your
          TypeScript patterns. Without it, you get generic code that requires heavy editing.

          AI is a useful debugging assistant if you give it the right information.
          Paste the error message plus the relevant code. Describe what you expected to

[paste the component]

I expected users to be an array from the API.
I already checked: the API returns 200 and the response body
contains the array. The fetch runs. But users is undefined
when the component renders."}`}

        <p className="text-base text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
          That prompt gives AI everything it needs to identify the cause — likely a missing

          If the answer is no — if you can only write code with AI assistance and would be
          stuck without it — you have a problem. Not because AI is going away, but because
          debugging, code review, and extending features all require understanding what the
          code is doing. If you skipped learning that, you cannot do those things.
        </p>
        <p className="text-base text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
          Use AI to go faster. Do not use it as a substitute for the hard work of
          understanding. The developers who will be most valuable in an AI-augmented world
          are the ones who deeply understand their systems and use AI to amplify that

          Think of AI as a very smart junior developer who has read every piece of code on
          the internet but has never shipped a production system. They are fast, they are
          knowledgeable about patterns, they write plausible-looking code — but they need
          direction, they miss business context, and they need their work reviewed.
        </p>
        <p className="text-base text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
          You are the senior. You provide the direction, the context, and the final review.
          You decide what goes out. That is not going to change — because the responsibility
          for what ships belongs to the engineer, not the tool.
        </p>
        <p className="text-base text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
          Used that way — as a fast, tireless assistant who needs supervision — AI is one
          of the most powerful tools you will ever have. Used as a replacement for
          thinking, it is how you ship subtle bugs to production with complete confidence.
